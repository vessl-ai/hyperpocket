# Overview

## What is Hyperpocket?

Hyperpocket is an open-source framework that makes it effortless to integrate, customize, and manage AI agent tools. Whether you're missing a specific tool or want to enhance an existing one, Hyperpocket lets you seamlessly connect open-source and managed tools to your AI workflows—without the hassle of building integrations from scratch.

## Why Hyperpocket?

Building AI agents often requires **custom tools and integrations**, but most providers don't offer the flexibility needed to modify or extend them.

With Hyperpocket, you can:

- **Seamlessly integrate** AI tools with your custom functions, third-party tools, git repository URLs, and more.

- **Securely authenticate** Simple authentication process without exposing credentials.

- **Go beyond Python**, supporting multi-language execution within an isolated environment.

- **Customize and extend** existing tools with the flexible open-source solutions.

Whether you're a researcher, developer, or product team, Hyperpocket removes friction in AI tool integration and empowers you to build without limits.

## Core Features & Benefits

### 1. Instant Integration with Open-Source & Managed Tools

Hyperpocket allows you to skip the tedious integration process and leverage existing AI tools right away.

- Effortlessly integrate AI tools from anywhere—whether it's your functions, any third party tools, git repo URL, and more.
- Seamlessly integrate existing managed services without vendor constraints.
- Reuse and extend existing open-source tools instead of building from scratch.

### 2. Built-in Secure Authentication

Handling authentication for AI agent tools can be complex and insecure. Hyperpocket provides a built-in auth layer, so you don't have to worry about managing credentials manually.

- Securely store API keys, OAuth tokens, and authentication data.
- Ensure credentials never leave your environment.
- Support multi-step authentication flows for complex security needs.

### 3. Fully Open-Source & Customizable

- Modify API responses to optimize outputs for your AI models.
- Customize workflows without vendor-imposed limitations.
- Share and collaborate by contributing custom tools to the open-source community.

### 4. Multi-Language Tool Support (Experimental)

While many AI tools are only available in python, Hyperpocket can run tools built with any programming language.
Hyperpocket natively supports executing within an isolated environment. Thus we can achieve supporting any languages including JavaScript, Rust, Go, and more

- Run AI tools in JavaScript, and any other languages like Rust, or Golang (to be added).
- Secure execution with isolated environments.
- Combine tools from different ecosystems into a single workflow.
