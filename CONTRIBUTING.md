## Creating pull requests

### Setup instructions

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Ensure you have **Python 3.10** or higher installed.
2. Fork the repository on GitHub.
3. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (our dependency management tool).
4. Clone your forked repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hyperpocket.git
   cd hyperpocket
```
5. Install the required dependencies for the package you want to work on:
```bash
   uv sync --frozen --dev
```

### Workflow guidelines

1. Create a new branch from main with a descriptive name, such as `feature/add-auth-provider` or `bugfix/fix-error-handling`:
```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-branch
```
2. Make your changes, ensuring your code is well-documented and follows our standards.
3. Run tests to ensure everything works as expected:
```bash
   uv run pytest
```
4. Lint and format your code:
```bash
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run ruff format .
```
5. Commit your changes with a clear message that explains what you did.
6. Push your branch and open a pull request to the `main` branch.
7. Discuss and revise as needed based on feedback from maintainers or the community.


### Code style

We adhere to strict coding standards to maintain consistency and quality across the codebase. We use [ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff) for linting and formatting, configured in `pyproject.toml`.

To keep your contributions consistent with our style, we recommend installing pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
These hooks automatically run checks whenever you commit, helping you quickly catch formatting or style issues. To manage the pre-commit hooks, we recommend to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).


## Documentation

We value clear and accurate documentation. If you'd like to contribute to our documentation, such as adding new content, fixing typos or inaccuracies, or enhancing clarity, feel free to submit issues or open pull requests, as we mentioned above.


## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to uphold a respectful and inclusive community.


## License

By contributing to Hyperpocket, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.
