# Overview

## What is Hyperpocket?

Hyperpocket is an open-source framework that makes it effortless to integrate, customize, and manage AI agent tools. Whether you’re missing a specific tool or want to enhance an existing one, Hyperpocket lets you seamlessly connect open-source and managed tools to your AI workflows—without the hassle of building integrations from scratch.

## Why Hyperpocket?

Building AI agents often requires **custom tools and integrations**, but most providers don’t offer the flexibility needed to modify or extend them.

With Hyperpocket, you can:

- **Instantly integrate** AI tools with GitHub link and Managed services.

- **Customize and extend** existing tools with open-source flexibility.

- **Securely authenticate** API connections without exposing credentials.

- **Go beyond Python**, supporting multi-language execution with WASM(WebAssembly).

Whether you’re a researcher, developer, or product team, Hyperpocket removes friction in AI tool integration and empowers you to build without limits.

## Core Features & Benefits

### 1. Instant Integration with Open-Source & Managed Tools

Hyperpocket allows you to skip the tedious integration process and leverage existing AI tools right away.

- Effortlessly integrate AI tools from any Git repository, even with just a link for GitHub repositories, no complex setup required.
- Seamlessly integrate existing managed services without vendor constraints.
- Reuse and extend existing open-source tools instead of building from scratch.

### 2. Built-in Secure Authentication

Handling authentication for AI agent tools can be complex and insecure. Hyperpocket provides a built-in auth layer, so you don’t have to worry about managing credentials manually.

- Securely store API keys, OAuth tokens, and authentication data.
- Ensure credentials never leave your environment.
- Support multi-step authentication flows for complex security needs.

### 3. Fully Open-Source & Customizable

Unlike closed platforms, Hyperpocket is **100% open-source**, giving you complete control over your AI tools.

- Modify API responses to optimize outputs for your AI models.
- Customize workflows without vendor-imposed limitations.
- Share and collaborate by contributing custom tools to the open-source community.

### 4. Multi-Language Tool Support (Experimental)

While many AI tools are only available in python, Hyperpocket can run tools built with any programming language.
Hyperpocket natively supports executing **WASM (WebAssembly)** file as a tool. Thus we can achieve supporting any languages that can be compiled into a WASM binary.
The WASM tool only have to get inputs from standard input(i.e. `scanf`), get some configurations and credentials from environment variable, and then print(i.e. `printf` or `console.log`) the result out that LLM can understand.

- Run AI tools in JavaScript, and any other languages that supports WASM compilation like Rust, or Golang (to be added)
- Secure execution with isolated environments.
- Combine tools from different ecosystems into a single workflow.

## Who is Hyperpocket for?

- **AI Engineers & Developers** looking for a modular, open-source tool integration framework.
- **Product Teams & MLOps Practitioners** needing flexible AI workflows without vendor lock-in.
- **Researchers & AI Enthusiasts** wanting to experiment with AI tools across different languages.

Hyperpocket is your fully open-source, extensible AI tool integration solution.
